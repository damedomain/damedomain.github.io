        <p>Dear diary,today while trodding down a quiet alley in an almost inconspicuous neighborhood of New Orleans, my senses where magically captured by one of the most mouthwatering smells I have ever come across. As I followed the enticing trail, a small establishment, wich looked almost as if it had been carved into the stone of the walls of the street, appeared <em>again</em> as if of nowhere, before my eyes. It was the cutest little bakery with one small door and a rather wide glass window beside it that let you view what looked like a minituare caffe. Displayed was one unique and delightfully cute table, a small wooden chair on each end, and at the back a counter behind wich you could see a busy elderly looking woman bustling around making and preparing things. Undoubtedly I had stumbled across one of those small jewells that one can only hope to ecounter by pure chance in a city.  </p>

      <h6>20 April 1980</h6>
      <p>Dear diary, today I want to dedicate my words to the magic of night strolls. I know many will prefer walking during the day, especialy in the spring time with nature blossoming all around, but I would like to share the magical magnestism that occurs below the stars. Some nights are just purely captivating, and the moon stole my heart many years ago. Even though I have seen it many times before, when I look up at the stary night I am always mesmerized, wondering about the patterns and shapes formed by the stars and the stage of the moon, it seems to have a have a quality that not only never grows old but always keeps you wanting more, a magestic but humble essence, a presence that you can always count on. No matter what goes on below you can always look up and be comforted by that everlasting magic.
